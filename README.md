### Up the River, Down the River Simulation

- Standard 52 card deck
- Cards are numbered relative to their face value (Ace is high)
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J,  Q,  K,  A
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

1-6 players

Random player starts with deck

Player to dealers left guesses a card 2-A

Dealer checks top card to see if player was correct

If wrong, dealer tells the player whether the card hes holding is higher or lower
than the guessed card

If wrong on second guess, dealer reveals card and next player starts process anew
The player that guesses incorrect twice must "drink" the difference between his final guess
and the actual card.

For example if the dealer is holding an 8 and the player guesses 2, the dealer responds by saying "higher". If the player then guesses K, then the player is 
wrong by K - 8 == 5 

If the player guesses correctly on either guess then the dealer must "drink".

If 3 players in a row do not guess the dealers card, the dealer becomes the player immediately to the left of the current dealer.

If a player guesses the dealers card correctly, the counter resets and the dealer must attempt to avoid a correct guess in three straight cards.

The dealer at the end of the game is the loser
